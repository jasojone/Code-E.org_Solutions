Minesweeper
 

You are given a board with n rows and m columns where any ' . ' makes a regular cell and any ' * ' marks a mine. For each regular cell, change its value to how many mines surround it from all eight directions.

Input
The first line contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 50) the number of rows and columns

Next, there will be a n by m grid with either ' . ' or ' * '.

Output
Output the correct board for minesweeper where each regular cell is replaced with the number of mines that surround it. If zero mines surround a cell leave a '0' for that space.
