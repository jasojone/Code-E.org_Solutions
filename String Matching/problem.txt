Sting Matching
 

Given a string a of size n, and a string b of size m, your job is to find if you can turn string a into string b by removing any character from string a as many times as you'd like.

Input
The first line of input contains t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), the number of queries to answer.

The first line of query contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n), the length of string a and the length of string b.

On the next line you will receive the two strings, a and b.

 

Output
For each query, output "YES" if you can turn string a into string b by removing any character from string a as many times as you'd like and "NO" if it is impossible to do so.
